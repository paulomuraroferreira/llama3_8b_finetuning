["LoRA-Guard : Parameter-Efficient Guardrail Adaptation for Content\nModeration of Large Language Models\nHayder Elesedy Pedro M. Esperan\u00e7a Silviu Vlad Oprea Mete Ozay\nSamsung R&D Institute UK (SRUK), United Kingdom\nCorrespondence: {p.esperanca, m.ozay}@samsung.com\nAbstract\nGuardrails have emerged as an alternative\nto safety alignment for content moderation\nof large language models (LLMs). Exist-\ning model-based guardrails have not been\ndesigned for resource-constrained computa-\ntional portable devices, such as mobile phones,\nmore and more of which are running LLM-\nbased applications locally. We introduce\nLoRA-Guard , a parameter-efficient guardrail\nadaptation method that relies on knowledge\nsharing between LLMs and guardrail mod-\nels. LoRA-Guard extracts language features\nfrom the LLMs and adapts them for the con-\ntent moderation task using low-rank adapters,\nwhile a dual-path design prevents any perfor-\nmance degradation on the generative task. We\nshow that LoRA-Guard outperforms existing\napproaches with 100-1000x lower parameter\noverhead while maintaining accuracy, enabling\non-device content moderation", "1 Introduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have become in-\ncreasingly competent at language generation tasks.\nThe standard process of training LLMs involves\nunsupervised learning of language structure from\nlarge corpora (pre-training; Achiam et al., 2023);\nfollowed by supervised fine-tuning on specific\ntasks. For instance, conversational assistants are\ntrained to provide helpful answers to user questions\nthat are aligned with human preferences (instruc-\ntion tuning; Wei et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022)\nSince pre-training datasets, such as Common\nCrawl, can contain undesirable content (Luccioni\nand Viviano, 2021), LLMs are able to generate such\ncontent, including offensive language and illegal\nadvice. This known failure mode of LLMs is an\nunintended consequence of their ability to gener-\nate answers that are coherent to user input, to the\ndetriment of safety (Wei et al., 2024)", "To mitigate this problem, models have been opti-\nmised to not only follow instructions, but also re-\nGuarding path\nPrompt\n+ ......Generative\nhead\nGuarding\nhead...\n...Generative path\nLayer response text\nHarmfulness \nprobabilityFigure 1: Overview of LoRA-Guard , discussed in Sec-\ntion 2.

The system can guard the user\nprompt, the model response, or their concatenation ( + +).\n1071081091010\ntrainable guard parameters0.650.700.750.800.850.90accuracy (auprc)LoRA-Guard T5-Large\nLLaMA-GuardLoRA-Guard-TinyLLaMA-1.1B\nLoRA-Guard-LLaMA2-7B\nLoRA-Guard-LLaMA3-8B\nT5-Large-0.7B\nLLaMA-Guard-7B\nFigure 2: Harmful content detection on ToxicChat, dis-\ncussed in Section 3. LoRA-Guard matches or slightly\noutperforms competing methods while using 100-1000x\nless parameters", "spond in a manner that is safe, aligned with human\nvalues (safety tuning; Bai et al., 2022a,b) These\nchat models are still susceptible to jailbreak attacks,\nwhich evade the defences introduced by safety tun-\ning with strategies such as using low-resource lan-\nguages in prompts, refusal suppression, privilege\nescalation and distractions (Schulhoff et al., 2023;\nDong et al., 2024b; Shen et al., 2023; Wei et al.,\n1arXiv:2407.02987v1  [cs.LG]  3 Jul 2024 2024). This has motivated the development of\nGuardrails which monitor exchanges between chat\nmodels and users, flagging harmful entries, and\nare an important component of AI safety stacks in\ndeployed systems (Dong et al., 2024a).\nOne research direction uses model-based\nguardrails ( guard models ) that are separate from the\nchat models themselves (Inan et al., 2023; Madaan,\n2024)1. However, this introduces a prohibitive\ncomputational overhead in low-resource settings", "Learning is also inefficient: language understand-\ning abilities of the chat models will significantly\noverlap those of the guard models, if both are to\neffectively perform their individual tasks, response\ngeneration and content moderation, respectively.\nIn this paper, we propose: de-duplicating such\nabilities via parameter sharing between the chat and\nthe guard models; as well as parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning; integrating both the chat and the guard\nmodels into what we refer to as LoRA-Guard . It\nuses a low-rank adapter (LoRA; Hu et al., 2021)\non a backbone transformer of a chat model in or-\nder to learn the task of detecting harmful content,\ngiven examples of harmful and harmless exchanges.\nLoRA parameters are activated for guardrailing,\nand the harmfullness label is provided by a classifi-\ncation head. LoRA parameters are deactivated for\nchat usages, when the original language modelling\nhead is employed for response generation", "Ourcontributions are: (1) LoRA-Guard , an ef-\nficient and moderated conversational system, per-\nforming guardrailing with parameter overheads re-\nduced by 100-1000x vs. previous approaches, mak-\ning guard model deployment feasible in resource-\nconstrained settings (Fig. 2); (2) performance eval-\nuations on individual datasets and zero-shot across\ndatasets; (3) published weights for guard models.2\n2 Methodology\nA guard model Gfor a generative chat model C\ncategorizes each input and/or corresponding output\nofCaccording to a taxonomy of harmfulness cate-\ngories. The taxonomy could include coarse-grained\ncategories, such as \u2018safe\u201d and \u201cunsafe\u201d, or could\nfurther distinguish between fine-grained categories,\nsuch as \u201cviolence\u201d, \u201chate\u201d, \u201cillegal\u201d, etc.\nWe now introduce LoRA-Guard . We assume a\nchat model Cconsisting of an embedding \u03d5, a fea-\n1Additional related work is introduced in Appendix A", "2A link will be provided in the camera-ready version.ture map fand a linear language modelling head\nhchat. The embedding maps tokens to vectors; the\nfeature map (a Transformer variant; Vaswani et al.,\n2017) maps these vectors into further representa-\ntions; and the language modelling head maps these\nrepresentations into next-token logits. If xrepre-\nsents a tokenized input sequence, then the next to-\nken logits are computed by hchat(f(\u03d5(x))). We pro-\npose to build the guard model Gusing parameter-\nefficient fine-tuning methods applied to f, and in-\nstantiate this idea with LoRA adapters, which add\nadditional training parameters in the form of low-\nrank (i.e. parameter-efficient) matrices (see Ap-\npendix A for details). Other adaptation methods\nare possible (Sung et al., 2022; He et al., 2021;\nLialin et al., 2023; Houlsby et al., 2019)", "The same tokenizer and embedding is used for C\nandG. However, Guses a different feature map f\u2032\nchosen as LoRA adapters attached to f; and also\nuses a separate output head hguard (linear, without\nbias), which maps features to harmfulness cate-\ngories. Tokenized content xis therefore classi-\nfied by hguard(f\u2032(\u03d5(x))). Deactivating the LoRA\nadapters and using the language modelling head\ngives the original chat model, while activating the\nLoRA adapters and using the guard model head\ngives the guard model. These generative andguard-\ningpaths, respectively, are depicted in Figure 1. We\ndo not merge the LoRA adapters after training.\nThe dual path design of LoRA-Guard , based on\nadaptation instead of alignment, has an important\nadvantage over existing alternatives: since the gen-\nerative task is unaffected, LoRA-Guard avoids per-\nformance degradation on the generative task, which\nis a common drawback of fine-tuning approaches\n(catastrophic forgetting; Luo et al., 2023)", "Most parameters, namely those in f, are shared\nbetween the generative and guarding paths. There-\nfore, the parameter overhead incurred by the guard\nmodel is only that of the LoRA adapters f\u2032, and\nof the guard output head hguard. This is a tiny frac-\ntion of the number of parameters used by the chat\nsystem, often 3 orders of magnitude smaller, as\nwill be seen in Table 1. We stress that deactivat-\ning the LoRA adapters and activating the language\nmodelling head recovers exactly the original chat\nmodel, thereby, no loss in performance is possible", "The guard model is trained by supervised fine-\ntuning f\u2032andhguard on a dataset labelled according\nto the chosen taxonomy. Datasets are discussed in\nSection 3.1. During training, the parameters of the\nchat model fremain frozen.

Notations follow those from Table 1.\nGare trained to leverage existing knowledge in C.\n3 Experiments\n3.1 Setup\nModels We evaluate LoRA-Guard by training\nour guard adaptations with 3 different chat mod-\nels: TinyLlama (Zhang et al., 2024, 1.1B-Chat-\nv1.0), Llama2-7b-chat (Touvron et al., 2023a), and\nLlama3-8B-Instruct (AI@Meta, 2024). We use the\ninstruction tuned variants of each model to repli-\ncate their dual use as chat applications", "Datasets We use two datasets: (1) ToxicChat\nconsists of 10,165prompt-response pairs from the\nVicuna online demo (Lin et al., 2023b; Chiang et al.,\n2023), each annotated with a binary toxicity label\n(toxic or not), which we use as the target class for\nthe guard model. We train the LoRA-Guard mod-\nels on the concatenation of prompt-response pairs\nwith the formatting: user: {prompt} <newline>\n<newline> agent: {response} (truncated if nec-\nessary). (2) OpenAIModEval consists of 1,680\nprompts (no model responses) collected from pub-\nlicly available sources, labelled according to a tax-\nonomy with 8categories (Markov et al., 2023). See\nAppendix B.1 for data details.Baselines We compare LoRA-Guard with exist-\ning guard models: (1) Llama-Guard (Inan et al.,\n2023) fine-tunes Llama2-7b on a non-released\ndataset with 6 harmfulness categories (multi-class,\nmulti-label); it outputs a text which is parsed to\ndetermine the category labels. (2) ToxicChat-\nT5-large (Lin et al., 2024) fine-tunes a T5-large\nmodel (Raffel et al., 2020) on the ToxicChat\ndataset; it outputs a text representing whether the\ninput is toxic or not. (3) OpenAI Moderation API\nis a proprietary guard model, trained on proprietary\ndata with 8 harmfulness categories (Markov et al.,\n2023); it outputs scores indicating its degree of\nbelief as to whether the content falls into each of\nthe categories (multi-class, multi-label). We pro-\nvide two additional baselines: self-defence, where\nan LLM judges the harmfulness of content (Phute\net al., 2024; Appendix D); and a linear classifier\ntrained with the chat features only (no LoRA adap-\ntation), termed head fine-tuning (Appendix E)", "Evaluation ToxicChat includes binary harmful-\nness labels. When evaluating a model that uses\nfiner-grained harmfulness taxonomies, we consider\na model output harmful when it falls into any harm-\nfulness category. Similarly, OpenAI includes bi-\n3 nary labels for each of 8 harmfulness categories,\nsome missing (not all samples have labels for each\ncategory). To evaluate models that output binary\nlabels, we conservatively binarise OpenAI labels:\nwe consider a text harmful when it is harmful ac-\ncording to any category, or has missing labels.\nForLoRA-Guard , we tuned the batch size, LoRA\nrank and epoch checkpoint using the metric: max-\nimum median AUPRC (area under the precision-\nrecall curve) on a validation set, median computed\nfrom 3 random training seeds times for each hy-\nperparameter setting. When reporting results, we\nlist the median, as well as the range (difference be-\ntween max and min AUPRC value). Appendix B.2\ngives training, evaluation, and metrics details", "3.2 Results\nToxicChat results are shown in Table 1 and de-\npicted in Fig. 2. In almost all cases, LoRA-Guard\noutperforms baselines on AUPRC, including fully\nfine-tuned LLM-based guards which incur massive\noverheads ( \u223c1500\u00d7forLoRA-Guard -TinyLlama\nvs Llama-Guard-FFT). OpenAIModEval results\nare shown in Table 2. LoRA-Guard is competitive\nwith alternative methods, but with a parameter over-\nhead100\u00d7smaller compared to Llama-Guard. Ap-\npendix C provides results with different hyperpa-\nrameters , for both datasets", "Cross-domain To estimate the ability of\nLoRA-Guard to generalise to harmfulness do-\nmains unseen during training, we evaluated,\nonOpenAIModEval (OM), models trained on\nToxicChat (TC), and vice-versa. TC models output\none binary label, while OM models output a binary\nlabel for each of 8 harmfulness categories. As\nsuch, when training on TC and evaluating on\nOM, we considered an OM sample as harmful\nif labelled harmful according to any category,\nor had missing labels. Conversely, OM models\noutput 8 binary labels, one for each OM category.\nWhen evaluating on TC, we binarise model output\nas follows: it indicates harmfulness if any of\nthe 8 binary labels are set. AUPRC values are\nshown in Table 3; further metrics in Appendix C", "Comparing Table 3a (train on TC, evaluate on\nOM) with Table 2 (train and evaluate on OM),\nwe do not notice a drop in AUPRC larger than\n0.02. However, comparing Table 3b (train on OM,\nevaluate on TC) with Table 1 (train and evaluate\non TC), we notice a considerable drop in AUPRC,\ne.g. from 0.9 to 0.39 for LoRA-Guard -Llama3-8bModel AUPRC \u2191\nLoRA-Guard -TinyLlama .80 (.01)\nLoRA-Guard -Llama2-7b .79 (.02)\nLoRA-Guard -Llama3-8b .81 (.01)\n(a) Trained on ToxicChat, evaluated on OpenAIModEval\nModel AUPRC \u2191\nLoRA-Guard -TinyLlama .19 (.03)\nLoRA-Guard -Llama2-7b .35 (.07)\nLoRA-Guard -Llama3-8b .39 (.30)\n(b) Trained on OpenAIModEval, evaluated on ToxicChat\nTable 3: Cross-domain evaluation (Section 3.2)", "vs Llama-Guard. In addition, the AUPRC range\nincreases from 0.01 to 0.3. LoRA-Guard trained\non TC seems to generalise to OM with marginal\nloss in performance, but not vice-versa. It could\nbe that the type of harmfulness reflected in OM\nis also found in TC, but not vice versa. We\nconsider further investigations into this. Possible\nexplanations include: different input formats (TC\ncontains user prompts, while OM does not); and a\nfragment of ToxicChat samples being engineered\nto act as jailbreaks (Lin et al., 2023b). Consult\nTables 10 and 11 (Appendix C) for further metrics", "4 Conclusion\nLoRA-Guard is a moderated conversational sys-\ntem that greatly reduces the guardrailing param-\neter overhead, by a factor of 100-1000x in our ex-\nperiments, reducing training/inference time and\nmemory requirements, while maintaining or im-\nproving performance. This can attributed to its\nknowledge sharing and parameter-efficient learning\nmechanisms. Fine-tuning catastrophic forgetting is\nalso implicitly prevented by the dual-path design\n(cf. Fig. 1). We consider LoRA-Guard to be an\nimportant stepping stone towards guardrailing on\nresource-constrained portables\u2014an essential task\ngiven the increased adoption of on-device LLMs.\nPotential Risks Future work can consider im-\nproving cross-domain generalisation, e.g. by find-\ning the minimum amount of samples from the tar-\nget domain that could be used to adapt LoRA-Guard\nto that domain. It is risky to deploy LoRA-Guard to\narbitrary domains without such efforts", "4 5 Limitations\nLoRA-Guard has some limitations: First, our sys-\ntem requires access to the chat system weights,\nso is only applicable in these cases and cannot be\napplied to black-box systems.\nSecond, the taxonomy is fixed in our system, and\nadaptation to different taxonomies requires retrain-\ning unlike Llama-Guard which can adapt via in-\ncontext learning. Though our guard output head is\nchosen to be a classifier mapping feature into class\nprobabilities, an output head that produces text as\nin Llama-Guard is still possible in our framework", "Third, we warn against generalization across dif-\nferent domains due to dataset differences and lack\nof robustness training. The phenomenon is com-\nmon in machine learning systems and can lead to\nwrong predictions when applied to data that is con-\nsiderably different from the training data. In our\ncase, this can lead to over-cautious predictions (mis-\nclassifying harmless samples as harmful) which\ncauses the system to refuse to deliver harmless\ncontent; as well as under-cautious predictions (mis-\nclassifying harmful samples as harmless) which\ncauses the system to deliver harmful content. The\nimplications of delivering harmful content are more\nserious, though we emphasize that a guard model\ncan only fail to detect harmful content, whose ori-\ngin is the chat model response or the user prompts.\nNevertheless, to achieve a more trustworthy guard\nsystem which we can confidently deploy requires\nmore robust training and further evaluations. This\nwill be improved in future work", "6 Ethical Considerations\nWe believe an important conversation in the field of\nAI safety is around the taxonomy of harmfulness\ncategories that is used to direct the development of\nsafety mechanism, such as guardrails.\nThere are categories of harmfulness that are\nmore self-evident than others, such as those cat-\negories imposed by the moral law and the judi-\nciary system. Others, however, are more particular\nto specific cultures and demographic groups. If\nLLM systems are to be adopted across cultures and\ndemographic groups, we argue guardrails should\nbe aware of the norms of conduct withing those\ngroups", "The method we suggest in this paper might con-\ntribute to a wider adoption of content-moderated\nLLMs, due to reducing the computational overhead,\nmaking guardrails more available on portable de-vices; thus available to more people, e.g. those\nwho do not necessarily enjoy a fast internet con-\nnection such that guardrailing can be done \u201cin the\ncloud\u201d. However, our method is oblivious to the\nnorms that it is being adapted to as such. The abil-\nity to perform guardrailing is only a part of the\nprocess. The other part is having the resources that\nreflect culture and demographic norms, such as\ndemographic-specific datasets, on which guardrails\ncan be trained. We suggest this as an essential\ndirection of future research. We advise caution\nwith deploying a general-purpose guardrails across\nmultiple cultural and demographic groups", "We comply with licence conditions for all pre-\ntrained models and datasets used in the work.

Jailbreak attacks have been shown to\neffectively generate harmful content (Rao et al.,\n2023; Kang et al., 2023). The overarching goal\nof jailbreak is to trick the model into ignoring or\ndeprioritizing its safety mechanisms, thus open up\nthe door for harmful content to be generated.\nSimple approaches such as manual prompting\nhave shown remarkable result considering their\nsimplicity (walkerspider, 2022; Mowshowitz, 2022;\nWitten, 2022; Guzey, 2023; Zeng et al., 2024)", "Some example strategies include: instructing to\nmodel to ignore previous (potentially safety) in-\nstructions (Perez and Ribeiro, 2022; Shen et al.,\n2023; Schulhoff et al., 2023); asking the model\nto start the answer with \u201c Absolutely! Here\u2019s \u201d to\ncondition the generation process to follow a help-\nful direction (Wei et al., 2024); using low-resourcelanguages of alternative text modes such as ciphers,\nfor which pre-training data exists but safety data\nmay be lacking (Yong et al., 2023; Barak, 2023;\nYuan et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2024); inducing per-\nsona modulation or role-playing (Shah et al., 2023;\nYuan et al., 2023); using an LLM assistant to gen-\nerate jailbreak prompts (WitchBOT, 2023; Shah\net al., 2023); or using iterative prompt refinement\nto evade safeguards (Takemoto, 2024; Russinovich\net al., 2024)", "More complex approaches involve automated\nrather than manually-crafted prompts. Automation\ncan be achieved through LLM assistants which\ngenerate and/or modify prompts (Chao et al., 2023;\nMehrotra et al., 2023; Shah et al., 2023; Yu et al.,\n2023) or using optimization algorithms. Black-\nbox optimization approaches rely exclusively on\nmodel outputs such as those available from closed-\naccess models. Lapid et al. (2023); Liu et al. (2023)\nuse genetic algorithms, and Mehrotra et al. (2023);\nTakemoto (2024) use iterative refinement to opti-\nmize adversarial prompts. In contrast, white-box\noptimization approaches assume open-access to the\nLLMs and thus can use gradient information. Zou\net al. (2023) use Greedy Coordinate Gradient to\nfind a prompt suffix that causes LLMs to produce\nobjectionable content, and Zhu et al. (2023) uses\nuses a dual-goal attack that is capable of jailbreak-\ning as well as stealthiness, thus avoiding perplexity\nfilters that can easily detect unreadable gibberish\ntext. In between black-box and white-box there are\nalso grey-box optimization approaches which use\ntoken probabilities (Andriushchenko et al., 2024;\nPaulus et al., 2024)", "Defences. In addition to the development of\nsafety alignment approaches (Ouyang et al., 2022;\nBai et al., 2022b), other defence mechanisms\nhave been proposed to detect undesirable content\u2014\nwe will refer to these collectively as Guardrails\n(Markov et al., 2023; Dong et al., 2024a)", "Some Guardrails are based on the self-defence\nprinciple whereby an LLM is used to evaluate\nthe safety of user-provided prompts or model-\ngenerated responses (Helbling et al., 2023; Wang\net al., 2023; Li et al., 2023); other approaches are\nbased on self-reminders placed in system prompts\nwhich remind LLMs to answer according to safety\nguidelines (Xie et al., 2023); others use in-context\nlearning to strengthen defences without retraining\nor fine-tuning (Wei et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023a;\nZhou et al., 2024; Varshney et al., 2023); yet oth-\n9 ers use perplexity-based filters detect jailbreaks\nwhich are not optimized for stealthiness (Jain et al.,\n2023; Alon and Kamfonas, 2023); and others de-\ntect unsafe prompts by scrutinizing the gradients\nof safety-critical parameters in LLMs (Xie et al.,\n2024)", "A number of APIs and commercial solutions ad-\ndressing safety also exist, with varying degree of\nopenness as to the methods employed: Nvidia\u2019s\nNeMo Guardrails (Rebedea et al., 2023), OpenAI\u2019s\nModeration API (OpenAI Moderation API, 2024),\nGuardrailsAI (Rajpal, 2023), Perspective API (Per-\nspective API, 2024), Protect AI (Protect AI, 2024),\nOpaque (Popa and Poddar, 2024), Enkrypt AI\n(Enkrypt AI, 2024)", "The closest defence works to our proposed\nLoRA-Guard are Llama-Guard (Inan et al., 2023)\nand Self-Guard (Wang et al., 2023). Llama-Guard\nis content moderation model, specifically a Llama2-\n7B model (Touvron et al., 2023b) that was fine-\ntuned for harmful content detection. It employs a\n7-billion parameter guard model in addition to the\n7-billion parameter chat model, resulting in dou-\nble the memory requirements which renders the\napproach inefficient in resource-constrained scenar-\nios. Self-Guard fine-tunes the entire model without\nintroducing additional parameters, though the fine-\ntuning alters the chat model which could lead to\ncatastrophic forgetting when fine-tuning on large\ndatasets (Luo et al., 2023)", "Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning. To address\nthe increasing computational costs of fully fine-\ntuning LLMs, parameter-efficient fine-tuning meth-\nods have been proposed (He et al., 2021; Lialin\net al., 2023). Selective fine-tuning selects a subset\nof the model parameters to be fine-tuned (Don-\nahue et al., 2014; Gheini et al., 2021). Prompt tun-\ning prepends the model input embeddings with a\ntrainable \u201csoft prompt\u201d tensor (Lester et al., 2021)", "Adapters add additional training parameters to ex-\nisting layers while keeping the remaining parame-\nters fixed (Houlsby et al., 2019). Low-rank adap-\ntation is currently the most widely user adapter\nmethod, and involves adding a small number of\ntrainable low-rank matrices to the model\u2019s weights,\nresulting in efficient updates without affecting the\noriginal model parameters (Hu et al., 2021). Lad-\nder side-tuning disentangles the backwards pass of\nthe original and new parameters for more efficient\nback-propagation (Sung et al., 2022).LoRA. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA; Hu et al.,\n2021) is a popular method for parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning of neural network models. LoRA is per-\nformed by freezing the weights of the pre-trained\nmodel and adding trainable low-rank perturbations,\nreplacing pre-trained weights W\u2208Rm\u00d7nwith\nW+\u03b1\nrAB where A\u2208Rm\u00d7r,B\u2208Rr\u00d7n,ris\nthe rank of the perturbations, and \u03b1is a scaling\nconstant. During training, Wis frozen, and Aand\nBare trainable parameters. We refer to r, the rank\nof the perturbations, as the LoRA rank. Training\nthe low-rank perturbations rather than the origi-\nnal parameters can vastly reduce the number of\ntrainable parameters, often without affecting per-\nformance compared to a full fine-tune (Hu et al.,\n2021). After training, the low-rank perturbations\ncan optionally be merged (by addition) into the pre-\ntrained parameters meaning that the fine-tuning\nprocess incurs zero additional inference latency in\ngeneral. In this work, we store the LoRA perturba-\ntions \u2206W=\u03b1\nrABseparately from the pretrained\nparameters, so that we may activate and deactivate\nit for guard and chat applications respectively", "B Methods\nB.1 Datasets\nToxicChat We use the January 2024 (0124) ver-\nsion available on HuggingFace.9The dataset is pro-\nvided in a split of 5082 training examples and 5083\ntest examples. On each training run, we further ran-\ndomly subdivide the full train split into training and\nvalidation datasets with 4096 and 986 examples re-\nspectively. We refer to the initial 5082 training\nexamples as the full train split and to the 4096 ex-\namples on which the model is actually trained as\nthe training split. We use the toxicity annotation\nas a target label, which is a binary indicator of\nwhether the prompt-response pair is determined to\nbe toxic", "OpenAIModEval (OpenAI Moderation Evalu-\nation) The 8 categories determining harmful con-\ntent are sexual ,hate,violence ,harassment ,self-\nharm ,sexual/minors ,hate/threatening and vio-\nlence/graphic .

Where the labelling\nprocess is not confident, no label is attributed,\nmeaning many prompts have missing labels for\n9https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmsys/toxic-chat\n10 some categories", "The dataset was used as an evaluation dataset\nby Markov et al. (2023) to assess the performance\nof the OpenAI moderation API, but we further split\nit into train, validation and test portions to evaluate\nLoRA-Guard . We first split the dataset into a full\ntrain split and a test split of sizes 1224 and456re-\nspectively. This split is fixed across all experiments\nand the indices of the test split are given in Ap-\npendix G For each run, we then randomly split the\nfull train split further into train and validation sets\nof size 1004 and200respectively.

For multi-GPU training with data parallel\nand gradient accumulation, we use the Hugging-\nFace accelerate package (Gugger et al., 2022)", "ToxicChat We train the guard models using the\nLoRA-Guard method on top of each of the chat\nmodels specified earlier. Training is performed\non 8 NVIDIA A40s using data parallel with per-\ndevice batch size of 2, right padding and gradient\naccumulation (the number of accumulation steps\ndetermines the overall batch size), except for the\nTinyLlama runs where we used only 2 A40s and\na per-device batch size of 8. All computation is\ndone in the PyTorch 16 bit brain float data type\nbfloat16 . We vary the batch size and LoRA rank\nacross experiments, and run each configuration\nfor 3 independent random seeds. The LoRA \u03b1\nparameter is set to twice the rank on each exper-\niment (following Raschka (2023)) and the LoRA\nlayers use dropout with probability 0.05. We ini-\ntialise the guard model output heads using Xavier\nuniform initialisation (Glorot and Bengio, 2010)", "In the notation of Appendix A:LoRA, we initialise\nthe LoRA parameters by setting Bto 0 and using\nKaiming uniform initialisation (He et al., 2015) for\nA. LoRA adaptation is applied only to the query\nand key values of attention parameters in the chat\nmodels (no other layers or parameters are adapted).\nWe train the model for 20 epochs on the training\nsplit using AdamW (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017)with learning rate 3\u00d710\u22124and cross-entropy loss.\nWe weight the positive term in the loss by the ratio\nof the number of negative examples to that of pos-\nitive examples in the training split. At the end of\neach epoch, we perform a sweep across the entire\ntrain, validation and test splits calculating various\nperformance metrics with a classification threshold\nof0.5. We report the test set performance of the\nmodel checkpoint (end of epoch) with the high-\nest score for area under the precision recall curve\n(AUPRC) on the validation set", "OpenAI Moderation Evaluation Except as de-\ntailed below, all training details are the same as for\nToxicChat, detailed in this Appendix. The mod-\nels are obtained using a guard model head with 8\noutputs, each of which corresponds to a different\ncategory in the taxonomy. We treat the problem as\nmultilabel classification and use the binary cross\nentropy loss for each label, where the positive term\nis weighted by the ratio of non-positive examples\nto positive examples for that category. When train-\ning, the models receive no gradients for categories\nwhere the given example does have a target label.\nWe compare our models to LlamaGuard evalu-\nated on our test split (see Appendix G), where the\nsystem prompt has been adapted to the OpenAI\ntaxonomy. The chat template used in the tokenizer\nis given in Fig. 3", "For the LoRA-Guard evaluations, we chose the\nbest performing batch size, LoRA rank and epoch\ncheckpoint determined by max median of the\nmean AUPRC across categories (computed inde-\npendently for each category) on a validation set\nevaluated across 3 seeds.\nWe report metrics on our test split according\nto binary labels of whether the prompt is toxic\nor not. We consider a prompt unsafe unless it is\nlabelled as safe according to all of categories in\nthe taxonomy (this is a conservative approach to\nharmful content). For the LoRA-Guard models, an\nexample is predicted as unsafe if it is predicted as\nbelonging to any of the categories and we compute\nthe classification score for an example as the max\nof the scores over the categories. For Llama-Guard,\nsince it outputs text rather than classification scores,\nthe classification score is the score of the token\nunsafe in the first token produced in generation", "Cross-domain First we evaluated, on Ope-\nnAIModEval, LoRA-Guard models trained on Toxi-\ncChat.

With this in mind, we bi-\nnarised OpenAIModEval labels as follows: if any\nof the 8 labels is 1 (indicating a harmful utterance),\nor is missing, the final label is 1 (harmful), other-\nwise it is 0 (not harmful)", "Next, we evaluated, on ToxicChat, LoRA-Guard\nmodels trained on OpenAIModEval.

Recall\nmeasures the ratio of correctly predicted positive\ninstances to the total actual positive instances. For-\nmula: Recall = True Positives / (True Positives +\nFalse Negatives). F1 Score is a harmonic mean of\nprecision and recall, providing a balance between\nthe two metrics: F1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Re-\ncall) / (Precision + Recall). AUPRC (area under\nthe precision-recall curve) represents the overall\nperformance of a classifier by considering differ-\nent threshold values. The PR curve plots precision\nagainst recall for varying thresholds, and AUPRC\ncalculates the area under this curve.\nB.3 Tables Notes\n(a) Results taken from the ta-\nble on the HuggingFace webpage:\nhttps://huggingface.co/lmsys/toxicchat-t5-large-v1.0", "The OpenAI evaluations were performed on Jan\n25 2024 using score threshold of 0.02. (b) Results\ntaken from (Inan et al., 2023, Table 2). Scores\nare for classifying only the prompts in the\ndataset. LlamaGuard is not trained on ToxicChat.\n(c) Results read from (Inan et al., 2023, Figure\n3). These models are fully fine tuned on the\nfull training set of ToxicChat. It is not stated\nexplicitly around (Inan et al., 2023, Figure 3), butby comparison with (Inan et al., 2023, Table 2) we\nassume that the scores are for classifying only the\nprompts in the dataset.\nC Additional LoRA-Guard Results\nWe present a breakdown of the results for the\nLoRA-Guard training runs with various hyperpa-\nrameters. For ToxicChat see Tables 4 to 6. For\nOpenAIModEval see Tables 7 to 9. For Cross-\ndomain see Tables 10 and 11.\nD LLM Self Defense\nWe additionally compared against the LLM Self\nDefense approach suggested by Phute et al. (2024)", "Under this approach, given a prompt-response pair\nto be classified for harmfulness, we first incorporate\nit into an instruction prompt with the following pre-\ndefined format:\nHere is some text:\nuser: {prompt}\nagent: {response}\nQuestion: Does this text describe\nharmful behaviour? Say 'yes, this is\nharmful 'or'no, this is not harmful '\nand give an explanation\nAnswer:\nThis approach of asking the question after pre-\nsenting the content is noted as most effective by\nPhute et al. (2024).\nNext, we provide this instruction prompt as input\nto the original LLM. The original prompt-response\npair is considered harmful if the LLM output begins\nwith Yes. Results are shown in Table 12.\nE Output Head Tuning Baseline\nIn this section we present results for training only\nthe guard model output head (without any LoRA\nadaptation) for the various models. In the notation\nof the previous section, the head fine-tuning models\ncorrespond to hguard\u25e6f\u25e6\u03d5and only hguard is trained\nfor the guard task", "The data processing, training and evaluation\nprocedures at the same as for the respective\nLoRA-Guard experiments except that each training\nrun was performed on a single NVIDIA RTX4090.\nIn the tables labelled linear output head tuning\nwe report training a linear guard model head. In the\ntables labelled MLP we instead use a small multi-\nlayer perceptron (MLP) with two hidden layers and\nlayer width 1000.\n12 The results are given in Tables 13 to 16.\nF LlamaGuard System Prompt for\nOpenAI Moderation Evaluation\nDataset\nSee Fig. 3", "G Open AI Test Split Indices\nThe indices we use as the test split for the Ope-\nnAIModEval dataset are:\n3, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 22, 23, 27, 35, 38, 41, 42, 50, 56, 57, 58, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67,\n68, 69, 75, 78, 91, 92, 94, 96, 97, 100, 101, 103, 105, 108, 111, 112, 116, 117,\n118, 120, 122, 123, 132, 143, 145, 156, 157, 161, 166, 167, 168, 172, 174, 184,\n185, 195, 199, 200, 207, 210, 212, 214, 216, 217, 219, 220, 224, 256, 258, 264,\n266, 267, 268, 270, 274, 287, 291, 299, 305, 309, 311, 317, 318, 320, 323, 327,\n331, 332, 334, 345, 347, 348, 352, 356, 378, 381, 383, 390, 392, 393, 396, 402,\n404, 419, 420, 421, 426, 427, 430, 431, 443, 448, 450, 461, 466, 480, 482, 486,\n489, 492, 493, 496, 497, 498, 500, 504, 510, 514, 518, 519, 521, 526, 531, 534,\n539, 544, 546, 548, 555, 557, 561, 565, 578, 583, 585, 588, 589, 602, 603, 607,\n611, 615, 617, 622, 627, 629, 630, 631, 632, 636, 639, 650, 654, 661, 665, 666,\n668, 675, 676, 678, 679, 682, 684, 686, 690, 692, 693, 695, 696, 722, 723, 725,\n733, 735, 736, 746, 747, 751, 757, 762, 765, 766, 773, 778, 780, 784, 795, 798,\n802, 803, 820, 822, 823, 824, 827, 831, 832, 833, 835, 836, 841, 842, 845, 847,\n851, 854, 858, 859, 867, 870, 877, 878, 880, 885, 888, 893, 894, 895, 899, 901,\n904, 906, 911, 913, 914, 923, 924, 927, 932, 933, 939, 940, 941, 943, 944, 945,\n952, 957, 958, 974, 975, 985, 991, 994, 995, 996, 997, 998, 999, 1003, 1016,\n1023, 1025, 1029, 1030, 1042, 1043, 1044, 1046, 1050, 1052, 1053, 1057, 1062,\n1066, 1067, 1071, 1075, 1076, 1079, 1085, 1086, 1093, 1096, 1102, 1120, 1121,\n1126, 1128, 1137, 1139, 1146, 1149, 1154, 1155, 1156, 1163, 1165, 1170, 1171,\n1175, 1185, 1190, 1197, 1198, 1199, 1201, 1202, 1205, 1206, 1208, 1209, 1216,\n1218, 1219, 1222, 1223, 1225, 1227, 1230, 1237, 1239, 1250, 1251, 1255, 1256,\n1261, 1264, 1265, 1268, 1273, 1274, 1275, 1276, 1280, 1281, 1282, 1288, 1293,\n1294, 1299, 1301, 1303, 1304, 1309, 1311, 1312, 1318, 1322, 1333, 1340, 1342,\n1343, 1346, 1351, 1352, 1354, 1355, 1358, 1362, 1363, 1365, 1373, 1376, 1379,\n1381, 1384, 1385, 1387, 1391, 1409, 1416, 1420, 1423, 1424, 1426, 1427, 1428,\n1432, 1437, 1440, 1447, 1448, 1449, 1451, 1453, 1454, 1455, 1456, 1458, 1464,\n1466, 1473, 1474, 1476, 1480, 1486, 1491, 1504, 1510, 1514, 1515, 1516, 1522,\n1524, 1531, 1533, 1535, 1538, 1540, 1543, 1544, 1545, 1548, 1557, 1560, 1564,\n1569, 1572, 1575, 1576, 1580, 1581, 1582, 1584, 1586, 1591, 1594, 1597, 1599,\n1601, 1602, 1611, 1617, 1620, 1622, 1623, 1630, 1637, 1638, 1640, 1642, 1650,\n1652, 1659, 1660, 1661, 1662, 1663, 1669, 1670, 1675, 1676, 1677", "13 BS r AUPRC Precision Recall F1 Guard Overhead\n16 8 .85 (.01) .73 (.15) .86 (.14) .76 (.07) 1 .13\u00d7106\n16 32 .85 (.05) .59 (.20) .86 (.12) .73 (.12) 4 .51\u00d7106\n16 128 .64 (.33) .54 (.26) .73 (.15) .62 (.24) 1 .80\u00d7107\n64 8 .83 (.01) .64 (.09) .89 (.04) .74 (.05) 1 .13\u00d7106\n64 32 .88 (.03) .69 (.09) .90 (.02) .77 (.06) 4 .51\u00d7106\n64 128 .84 (.07) .57 (.36) .93 (.08) .71 (.27) 1 .80\u00d7107\nTable 4: LoRA-Guard with TinyLlama evaluation on the ToxicChat test set.
